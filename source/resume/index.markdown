<h2>About Me</h2>
<p class="underBorder">
During my time as a Software Engineering student, I have worked at several organizations under different software development methodologies.
Through my experience, I have come to prefer the agile development methodology.
I enjoy the close cooperation between developers, designers and product managers in an iterative process to develop a compelling product.
I particularly enjoy working in the mobile and web domains.
In my spare time I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, blogging, reading, and watching far too many TV shows.

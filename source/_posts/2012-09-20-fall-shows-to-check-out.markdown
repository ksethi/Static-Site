As a TV junkie, I tend to get quite excited around September. 
New TV season means the return of the old favourites as well as some cool new shows. 
Here are some of the new pilots I'd recommend checking out this season.

##Revolution
###NBC - Premiered September 17/2012

Revolution takes place in the post-apocaliptic future where humanity has reverted to a primitive civilization. 
The pilot starts with a regular day on Earth building up to an event that causes all electricity across the planet to stop working. 
15 years later the search for a reason continues. I checked out the pilot and found it interesting and action-packed.
The storyline definately provides a similar "LOST" feeling.
I'll keep watching this one and I hope this doesn't go the way of Terra Nova. Check out the trailer below.

##Partners
###CBS - Premieres September 24/2012

An upcoming sitcom about two best friends, Louis and Joe, who are partners at an architecture firm. 
Things get murky when Joe gets engaged and Louis enters a new relationship. 
The significant others don't tend to get along and comedy ensues.
The story reminds me of the early dynamics of the Ted and Marshall relationship from How I Met Your Mother. 
Have a look at a preview below.

##Elementary
###CBS - Premieres September 27/2012

Welcome to Sherlock Holmes in NYC where Dr. Watson is a girl. 
Recently finished watching the BBC series "Sherlock" and I'm not sure if I'll get hooked on this one.
Conversation in the trailer looks sharp and I think it will be interesting to see how the American modernization stands up against its British counterpart.
Since Sherlock won't be back for Season 3 for a while, most addicts will have to get their deductive cravings from this one.

##Arrow
###The CW - Premieres October 10/2012

Its been a while since I've seen a new superhero TV series. 
This one follows the life of Oliver Queen and his transformation into the Green Arrow. 
I'm a little skeptical of this one but think its still worth checking out the pilot. 
Enjoy the trailer.

##Go On
###NBC - Premiered September 11/2012

**Matthew Perry is Back! Matthew Perry is Back! Matthew Perry is Back!**

Hopefully this time he will be around for longer than 3 months (Mr. Sunshine). 
Go On features Matthew Perry as sportscaster Ryan King. 
Ryan has recently suffered from the tragic death of his wife and isn't dealing too well. 
That's where his support group comes in handy.

That's all folks!
